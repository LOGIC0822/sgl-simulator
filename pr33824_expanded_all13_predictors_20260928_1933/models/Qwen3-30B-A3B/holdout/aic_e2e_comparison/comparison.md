# Collected SGLang ML replay comparison

## Scope

Each row pairs a real SGLang serving result with a CPU simulator replay of that run's converted raw request trace. The replay uses the same token IDs, completed output lengths, relative arrival times, context length, request limit, chunked-prefill size, and real service token-pool limit. The real server uses device-synchronized collection with overlap scheduling and CUDA graph disabled.

Total token throughput uses actual trace input+output counts divided by the original measured benchmark duration; the benchmark's nominal pre-decode input count can differ after text re-tokenization. Original reported throughput and token counts are retained in comparison.csv. Client and simulator timing boundaries remain different; this correction aligns only token counting.

## Teacher-forced scheduler-batch score

This score uses the real observed batch composition and therefore does not include scheduler feedback.

- batches: 12223
- MAPE: 63.923%
- MAE: 64.904 ms

## Reading the numbers

The table is descriptive. Teacher-forced batch error and end-to-end replay error answer different questions: the latter also changes future batch formation when a predicted latency differs from the real one. These rows do not isolate every runtime component, such as request handling and host scheduling, from GPU forward time.
